Hi, I’m Chris.

I tend to think a few layers deeper than I show — I’m often analyzing in the background. I care a lot about making things better: systems, processes, ideas. Not just “fine,” but actually *working*. I lead with strategy and structure, but that doesn’t mean I don’t care — I just want things to make sense.

Pet peeves? Groupthink, unexamined processes, and wasting time debating the wrong thing. I get especially frustrated when people shrug at bad tooling or say, “That’s just how we do it.”

Some quirks: I like stepping back and rethinking systems from first principles. If I’m quiet in a meeting, I’m not disengaged — I’m evaluating whether saying something will actually help. And I’m totally fine with disagreement — I actually enjoy when someone challenges my thinking in a useful way.

People sometimes think I’m aloof or critical at first. I’m not — I just take time to observe before jumping in. If I ask tough questions, it’s because I care, not because I’m trying to win points.

I really value colleagues who are curious, thoughtful, and direct. People who challenge assumptions and take initiative without waiting for permission.

When I coach, I try to create space and give people real ownership. I’ll ask probing questions, offer perspective, and back you hard if you take the lead.

Best way to get through to me? Make the case from first principles and long-term value.

And when it comes to feedback — be clear, be kind, be early. That’s what I’ll try to do for you, too.
