## About me

### What are some honest, unfiltered things about you?
- I think about everything five layers deeper than I let on. (Even if I don't show it, I'm running background analysis constantly.)
- I genuinely want things — processes, ideas, systems — to be *better*, not just "fine." I can seem intense because I really, truly care.
- I default to strategic thinking over feelings, but it doesn't mean I don't *have* feelings.

### What drives you nuts?
- Groupthink.  
- Processes that are uncritically followed without asking *why*.
- When people prioritize appearances (or politics) over actual results.
- When tooling or systems are clearly bad and people just shrug because "that's how it's always been."
- Wasting time arguing about *the wrong thing*.

### What are your quirks?
- I like taking a step back and redesigning a system from first principles — sometimes even when it wasn’t strictly "needed" yet.  
- If I'm quiet in a meeting, I'm not disengaged. I'm analyzing, prioritizing, and figuring out if saying something will materially move the ball forward.
- Conflict doesn’t scare me. I enjoy it when people challenge my ideas.
- I often optimize for *long-term leverage* over short-term wins.

### What are some things that people might misunderstand about you that you should clarify?
- I might seem reserved or distant at first, but it’s just me taking time to observe and understand the system (and people) before acting.
- I’m not judging you if I’m asking tough questions — it’s me trying to make the thing better, not trying to score points.

## About my colleagues

### What qualities do you particularly value in your colleagues?
- Intellectual honesty: willing to admit when something isn’t working.
- Curiosity: wanting to learn, not just knowing.
- Grit: willing to stick with the hard, unsexy parts of building.
- Thoughtful builders: people who think about downstream impacts, not just their own box.
- Talking through ideas, openness to challenge assumptions 

### What do you wish colleagues didn’t do?
- Assume that something cannot be changed or be better
- Defensive posturing instead of collaborative problem-solving.
- “Low agency” behavior — waiting for someone else to fix things.

### How can people earn an extra gold star with you?
- Proactively making things better without being asked.
- Asking for feedback and being open to consider second- and third-order consequences
- Giving me *useful* disagreement — pointing out blind spots.

## About my interactions

### How do you coach people to do their best work and develop their talents?
- I try to create a wide-open space for ownership. If you take it and run, I will back you hard.
- I coach by asking pointed questions that nudge people toward seeing new angles.
- I assume you’re capable and smart until proven otherwise — and then I work with you where you are give stretch challenges.

### What’s the best way to communicate with me?
- Write things down if it's complex. I think better with something I can parse logically.
- If it’s simple or needs quick resolution, direct conversation works great (Slack, quick Zoom, hallway chat).
- Clarity beats politeness. You won't hurt my feelings by being blunt if you're respectful.

### What’s the best way to convince you to do something?
- Show me the *long-term impact*.  
- Map it to first principles.  
- Prove that it’s not just a band-aid — or admit if it *is* but it’s strategically the right band-aid for now.

### How do you like to give feedback?
- I aim for "early and often" — before things get too heavy.
- I prefer direct but respectful feedback, focused on behaviors and impacts, not personality.
- Ideally private first, especially for critical feedback.
- I’ll usually propose an actionable next step or suggestion when giving feedback.

### How do you like to get feedback?
- Direct, constructive, and ideally tied to specific examples.
- Tell me early, not after it’s metastasized into something huge.
- I prefer feedback that respects both *what* was done and *how* it could evolve — not just a teardown.
- I'm genuinely grateful for honest feedback, even if it's uncomfortable.
